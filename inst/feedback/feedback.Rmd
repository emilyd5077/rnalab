Some feedback on your project, necessarily brief because of the class
size. 

## Comments

Your package has a few problems, but not major ones.

1. Your report has a long listing of a dataset; you should summarize
   better. Otherwise, your report is good enough.
2. Your partitioning of tasks is also good.
3. Your shiny app is not usable by a general user. Unless one knows
   what one is looking for, it is hard to make the choices and run an
   example. The tabs could have been designed to provide some help
   here, including example settings to run a full example.
